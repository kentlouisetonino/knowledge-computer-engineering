```

> - `Code Injection` is a type of attack that allows an attacker <br />
    to inject malicious code into an application through a user <br />
    input field, which is then executed on the fly.

> - Preventing code injection attacks usually comes down to <br />
    reconsidering the need to dynamically execute code, especially <br />
    where user input is involved.
