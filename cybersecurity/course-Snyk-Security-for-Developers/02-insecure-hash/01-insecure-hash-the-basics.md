## $\textnormal{What is Insecure Hash?}$

> - `Hashing` refers to taking some input value, usually a <br />
    password, and then producing a fixed length, `fingerprint` <br />
    from it.

> - Unlike `Encryption` where the original message can be <br />
    retrieved, there is no (algorithmic) way of reversing a <br />
    hash back to its original value.

> - An insecure hash vulnerability is a failure related to <br />
    cryptography.

> - `Cryptography` being the way we encrypt or hash data.

> - By having an insecure hash there is a high chance that your <br />
    data will be exposed.

> - Hashes can also be insecure due to rainbow tables or hash <br />
    collisions.

MD5 Hash Algorithm
    - Was developed in 1991 and released in 1992.
    - In 2005, it was deemed unsuitable, yet, in 2019, it was
      estimated that 25% of content management systems still
      use MD5.
