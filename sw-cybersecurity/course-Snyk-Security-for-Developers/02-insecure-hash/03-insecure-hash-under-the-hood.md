## $\textnormal{What Happened?}$

> - An `MD5` hash can be brute force in a matter of seconds.

> - Hashing passwords is the correct way to handle passwords, <br />
    but it must be done using a secure hash function.

> - Outdated hash function such as `MD5`, `SHA-`, or some <br />
    or some others, should be avoided.

> - In Go, you can import the `bcrypt` library to handle all <br />
    of your cryptography needs.
