## $\textnormal{What is Insecure Randomness?}$

> - `Insecure Randomness` refers to random numbers or data <br />
    that do not have enough entropy, or randomness, to be <br />
    considered truly random.

> - Occurs when a function that is expected to a random value <br />
    actually has a predictable output, allowing an attacker to <br />
    compromise security.

> - Computers are not able to produce truly random values due <br />
    to their deterministic nature, so Pseudo-Random Number <br />
    Generators are used instead.

> - The predictability of the output of these generators varies <br />
    significantly.
