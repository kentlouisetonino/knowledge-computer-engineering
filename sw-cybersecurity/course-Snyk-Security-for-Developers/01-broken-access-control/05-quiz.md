1. Which of the following best represents a secure approach
   to access control in applications?
        - A "deny by default" approach ensures that resources are
          secure by default and access is granted only when explicitly
          allowed by roles or permissions.
        - This approach minimizes the risk of unauthorized access and
          helps maintain a secure application.
