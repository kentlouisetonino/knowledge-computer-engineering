## $\textnormal{What is Broken Access Control}$

> - `Access Control` refers to the permissions structure that <br />
    should be defined by the application.

> - For examples, your application may have separate roles for <br />
    regular users and administrators.

> - Regular users should not be able to obtain privileged access, <br />
    but administrators should.

> - When the access control of an application is broken, a regular <br />
    user may be able to access functionality that is meant to be <br />
    reserved for administrators, or perhaps they can access data <br />
    that does not belong to them.

## $\textnormal{Authorization vs. Authentication}$

> - `Authentication` is the process of determining who someone is.

> - `Authorization` is the process of determining what that person <br />
    is allowed to do, or what they have access to.

> - Broken access control is referred to authorization, not authentication.
