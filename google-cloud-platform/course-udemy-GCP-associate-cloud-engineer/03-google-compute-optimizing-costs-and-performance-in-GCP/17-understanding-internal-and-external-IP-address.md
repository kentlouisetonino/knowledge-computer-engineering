> - `External (Public) IP` addresses are internet addressable.

> - `Internal (Private) IP` addresses are internal to a corporate network.

> - You cannot have two resources with same public (External) IP addresses.

> - However, two different corporate networks can have resources with same <br />
    internal (private) IP address.

> - All VM instances are assigned at least one internal IP address.

> - Creation of External IP addresses can be enabled for VM instances.

> - When you stop an VM instance, external IP address is lost.
