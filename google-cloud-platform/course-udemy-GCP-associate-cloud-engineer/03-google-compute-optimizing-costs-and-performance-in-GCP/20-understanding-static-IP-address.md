## $\textnormal{Understanding Static IP Addresses in GCP}$

> - Static IP can be switched to another VM instance <br />
    in same project.

> - Static IP remains attached even if you stop the <br />
    instance, but you can manually detach it.

> - You are `BILLED` for an static IP when you are not <br />
    using it as well.

> - Release the Static IP if not used in order not to <br />
    be billed.
