> - When you hit the power button on your computer and milliseconds before <br />
    that delightful boot screen logo appears, an unsung hero is hard at <br />
    work: `bootloader`.

> - `Bootloaders` whip up everything your operating system needs to wake <br />
    up and function.

> - `Bootloader` is a small but very powerful program that runs before your <br />
    operating system kicks in.

> - It `load` and `initialize` the operating system.

> - Without `bootloaders`, your operating system would not know where to start.
