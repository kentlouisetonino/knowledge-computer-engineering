### A SEQUENCE OF STEPS

> - Conceptually, a workflow defines a sequence of step.

> - With Temporal, those steps are defined by writing code, known as `Workflow Definition`,
    and carried out by running that code, which results in a `Workflow Execution`.

### WORKFLOW EXAMPLES
#
> - You probably encounter workflows every day.

> - Some examples might include subscribing to an entertainment service, buying concert
    tickets, booking a vacation, ordering a pizza, or filing an expense report.
