### WHAT IS TEMPORAL
#
> - `Temporal` is a platform that guarantees the durable execution of your application code.

> - It allows you to develop as if failures don't even exist.

> - Your application will run reliably even if it encounters problems, such as network
    outages or server crashes, which would be catastrophic for a typical application.

> - The `Temporal` platform handles these types of problems, allowing you to focus on the
    business logic, instead of writing application code to detect and recover from
    failures.

### WORKFLOWS
#
> - Temporal application are built using an abstraction called `Workflows`.

> - You'll develop those `Workflows` by writing code in a general-purpose programming
    language such as Go, Java, TypeScript, or Python.

> - The code you write is the same code that will be executed at runtime, so you can use
    your favorite tools and libraries to develop Temporal Workflows.

> - Temporal Workflows are resilient.

> - They can run - and keeping running - for years, even if the underlying infrastructure
    fails.

> - If the application itself crashes, Temporal will automatically recreate its pre-failure
    state so it can continue right where it left off.
