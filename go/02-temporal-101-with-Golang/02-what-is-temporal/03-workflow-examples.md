### EXPENSE REPORT
#
> - Like the other workflows, filing an expense report involves a sequence of steps.

> - First, you create the report, describe the items you purchased, attach receipts
    if necessary, and then you submit it.

> - The manager then reviews it, either rejecting it (in which case you'll be
    notified so you can fix the problem and resubmit if necessary) or approving it.

> - If approved, the accounting department will process it, reimburse you by sending
    a check or direct deposit, and then let you know they've done so.

> - They will also archive this report so it's available in case of an audit.

### MONEY TRANSFER
#
> - Another interesting to observe about a workflow is that it can composed of other
    workflows.

> - In the case of the expense report scenario, you might think of the reimbursement
    as a single step, but it's actually two distinct operations.
