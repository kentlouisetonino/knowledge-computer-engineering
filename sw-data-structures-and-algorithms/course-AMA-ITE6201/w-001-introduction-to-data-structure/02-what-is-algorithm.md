## What is Algorithm?

> - `Algorithm` is a step-by-step procedure, which defines a set <br />
    of instructions to be executed in a certain order to get the <br />
    desired output.


> - `Algorithms` are generally created independent of underlying <br />
    languages, that is, and algorithm can be implemented in more <br />
    than one programming language.

> - Most algorithms of interest involve methods of organizing the <br />
    data involved in the computation.

> - The objects that are created in this way are called `data strucutres`.
