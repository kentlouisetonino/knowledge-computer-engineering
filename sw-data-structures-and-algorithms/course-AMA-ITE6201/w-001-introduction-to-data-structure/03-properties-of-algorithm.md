## Properties of Algorithm

> - An algorithm should have the following properties:

|   |   |
| - | - |
| Unambiguous | Should be clear and unambiguous, Each steps, <br /> inputs/outputs should be precisely defined. |
| Input | Should have 0 or more well defined values as inputs. |
| Output | Should produce some value as output, and should <br /> match the desired output. |
| Finiteness | Must terminate after a finite number of steps. |
| Effectiveness | All of the operations to be performed must be <br /> sufficiently basic that they can in principle be done <br /> exactly and in finite time by a person using only <br />  pencil and paper. |
