## Analysis of Algorithm

> - We will now discuss how to compare algorithms mainly in terms <br />
    of running time, memory, etc.

> - In computer science, multiple algorithms are available for <br />
    solving the same problem, for example, a sorting problem has <br />
    has many algorithms like insertion sort, bubble sort, quick sort, etc.

> - Thus by algorithm analysis, we determine which algorithm is <br />
    most efficient in terms of time and space consumed.

<br />
<br />



## Running Time Analysis

> - `Running time analysis` is the process of determining how processing <br />
    time increases as the size of the problem increases.

> - Input size is the number of elements in the input, and depending on <br />
    the problem type, the input may be of different types.

| Common Types of Inputs |
| ---------------------- |
| Size of an Array |
| Polynomial Degree |
| Number of Elements in a Matrix |
| Vertices and Edges in a Graph |
