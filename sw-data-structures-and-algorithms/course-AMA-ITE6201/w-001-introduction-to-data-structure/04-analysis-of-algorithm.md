## Analysis of Algorithm

> - We will now discuss how to compare algorithms mainly in terms <br />
    of running time, memory, etc.

> - In computer science, multiple algorithms are available for <br />
    solving the same problem, for example, a sorting problem has <br />
    has many algorithms like insertion sort, bubble sort, quick sort, etc.

> - Thus by algorithm analysis, we determine which algorithm is <br />
    most efficient in terms of time and space consumed.
