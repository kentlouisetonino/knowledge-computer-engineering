## What is Data Structure?

> - In solving a problem with or without a computer it is necessary <br />
    to choose an abstraction of reality, i.e., to define a set of <br />
    data that is to represent the real situation.

> - When selecting a data structure to solve a problem, you should <br />
    follow these steps:

```plaintext
(1) Analyze your problem to determine the basic operations that
    must be supported. Examples of basic operations include
    inserting a data item into the data structure, deleting a data
    item from the data structure, and finding a specified data item.

(2) Quantify the resource constraints for each operation.

(3) Select the data structure that best meets these requirements.
```

> - `Data Structure` is a way of storing and organizing data in a <br />
    computer so that it can be used efficiently.


> - `Data Structure` is a specialized format for organizing and <br />
    storing data.

> - `Data Structure` types includes arrays, linked list, stacks, <br />
    queues, trees, graphs and so on.

> - The term `Data  Structure` often refers to data stored in a computer's <br />
    main memory.

##  Data Structures are Classified into Two Types

<br />

| (1) Linear Data Structure |
| ------------------------- |
| Elements are accessed in a sequencial order but <br /> is not compulsory to store all elements sequentially. |
