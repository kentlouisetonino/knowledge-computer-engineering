## What is Linked List?

> - `Linked List` contains of a sequence of nodes, joined by links.

> - Each node contains a single element, together with links to one or <br />
    both neighboring nodes.

<br />

> - A `linked list`, in its simplest form, is a collection of `nodes` <br />
    that together form a linear ordering.

> - A `linked list`, can contain any type of data, strings, characters, <br />
    and numeric. The elements can be sorted or unsorted.

> - A `node successor` is the next node in the sequence, and its predecessor <br />
    is the previous node in the sequence. The last node in the sequence has <br />
    no successor, and the first node in the sequence has no predecessor.

> - A `null link` is used wherever there is no node to link to. Thus every <br />
    node in a linked list contains a link to its successor, but the last <br />
    node contains a null link instead.

> - A `length` of a linked list is the number of nodes (elements) in it. A <br />
    linked list is empty if it has length of zero.

> - We can access the element in any node, provided that we have a link to <br />
    that node.

> - We can manipulate the links. This makes it possible to achieve a variety <br />
    of effects. We can insert and delete nodes, thus varying the linked list <br />
    length dynamically. We can change the order of the nodes. In fact, we can <br />
    make arbitrary changes to a linked list structure simply by manipulating <br />
    the links.

> - In linked lists we have a choice between linking each node to one or both <br />
    of its immediate neighbors.

| (2) Doubly-Linked Lists (DLLs) |
