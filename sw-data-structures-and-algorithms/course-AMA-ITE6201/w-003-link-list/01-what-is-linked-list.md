<br />

> - A `linked list`, in its simplest form, is a collection of `nodes` <br />
    that together form a linear ordering.

> - A `linked list`, can contain any type of data, strings, characters, <br />
    and numeric. The elements can be sorted or unsorted.

> - A `node successor` is the next node in the sequence, and its predecessor <br />
    is the previous node in the sequence. The last node in the sequence has <br />
    no successor, and the first node in the sequence has no predecessor.

> - A `null link` is used wherever there is no node to link to. Thus every <br />
    node in a linked list contains a link to its successor, but the last <br />
    node contains a null link instead.
