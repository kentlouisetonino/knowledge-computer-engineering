## Singly Linked List (SLL)

> - Each `SSL` node contains an element, together with a link <br />
    to its successor or a null link if the node has no successor.

> - The `SSL` has a header, which contains a link to the `SLL` <br />
    first node or a null link if the SLL is empty.

> - A singly linked list retains its elements in a certain order. This <br />
    order is determined by the chain of `next` links going from each <br />
    node to its successor in the list.

> - A `singly linked list` does not have a fixed size unlike array, <br />
    and uses space proportional to the number of its elements.

> - Likewise, we do not keep track of any index numbers for the nodes <br />
    in a linked list.

> - We cannot tell just by examining a node if it is the second, or <br />
    fifth node in the list.
