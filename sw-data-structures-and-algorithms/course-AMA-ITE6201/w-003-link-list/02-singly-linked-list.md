## Singly Linked List (SLL)

> - Each `SSL` node contains an element, together with a link <br />
    to its successor or a null link if the node has no successor.

> - The `SSL` has a header, which contains a link to the `SLL` <br />
    first node or a null link if the SLL is empty.

> - A singly linked list retains its elements in a certain order. This <br />
    order is determined by the chain of `next` links going from each <br />
    node to its successor in the list.

> - A `singly linked list` does not have a fixed size unlike array, <br />
    and uses space proportional to the number of its elements.

> - Likewise, we do not keep track of any index numbers for the nodes <br />
    in a linked list.

> - We cannot tell just by examining a node if it is the second, or <br />
    fifth node in the list.

| Aspect | Linked List |
| ------ | ----------- |
| `Size` | Size of the list is not fixed. <br /> Size can grow. |
| `Storage Capacity` | Dynamic: It's node is located during runtime. |
| `Order and Sorting` | Stored randomly. |
| `Accessing the Element` | Sequencial access method. <br /> Traverse starting from the first node in the list by pointer. |
| `Searching` | Linear search. |

> - A `linked list` is a collection of nodes that together form <br />
    a linear ordering.

> - The ordering is identified as in the `Follow the Leader` in <br />
    that each node is an object that stores a reference to an <br />
    element and a reference, called `next`, to another node.

> - `Link` or `pointer` to another node is the next reference inside <br />
    a node.

> - Likewise, is known as `link hopping` or `pointer hopping` is moving <br />
    from one node to another by following a next reference.

> - The first node of a linked list is called `head` while the last <br />
    node is called `tail` of the list.
