## Abstract Data Type

> - An `Abstract Data Type` (ADT) is a set of objects together with <br />
    a set of operations.

> - Abstract data types are mathematical concepts; nowhere in an ADT's <br />
    definition is there any mention of how the set of operations is <br />
    implemented.

> - Objects such as lists, sets, and graphs, along with their operations, <br />
    can be viewed as ADT's, just as integersm, reals, and Booleans are <br />
    data types.

> - Integers, floats, and Booleans have operations associated with them <br />
    and so do ADTs.

> - ADT is a mathematical model with a collection of operations defined <br />
    on model.
