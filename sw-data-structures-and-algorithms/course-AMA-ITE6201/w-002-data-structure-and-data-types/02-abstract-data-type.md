## Abstract Data Type

> - An `Abstract Data Type` (ADT) is a set of objects together with <br />
    a set of operations.

> - Abstract data types are mathematical concepts; nowhere in an ADT's <br />
    definition is there any mention of how the set of operations is <br />
    implemented.

> - Objects such as lists, sets, and graphs, along with their operations, <br />
    can be viewed as ADT's, just as integersm, reals, and Booleans are <br />
    data types.

> - Integers, floats, and Booleans have operations associated with them <br />
    and so do ADTs.

> - ADT is a mathematical model with a collection of operations defined <br />
    on model.

> - An ADT should have a `contract` (or specification) that:

| (1) Declaration of Data |
| ----------------------- |
| Specifies the set of values of the abstract data type. |

<br />

| (2) Declaration of Operations |
| ----------------------------- |
| Specifies each operations of the abstract data type <br /> (i.e. specifies the operation's name, its parameter, types, results, etc. |

<br />

> - The noticeable behavior of an operation is the effect <br />
    of that operation as observed by the code.

> - Consider the example where there is an operation that <br />
    sorts a sequence of values.

> - The code that calls this operation will be able to <br />
    tell that the values has been sorted.

> - But cannot observe the detailed step-by-step by which <br />
    the operation achieves the result.
