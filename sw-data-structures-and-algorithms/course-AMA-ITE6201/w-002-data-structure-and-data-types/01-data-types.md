## Data Types

> - `Data` are the raw material of computation.

> - We can define the characteristics of a data type to be:

```plaintext
- Set of values.
- A data representation, which is common to all these values.
- A set of operations which can be applied uniformly to all these values.
```

> - A `data type` in a programming language is a set of data <br />
    with values having predefined characteristics (Examples are, `integer`, <br />
    `character`, `floating point number`, `string`, etc.).

> - The memory inside a computer contains only zeros and ones.

> - Programming languages and compilers are providing the <br />
    facility of data types.

> - For example, integer takes 2 bytes, this says that, in <br />
    memory we are combining 2 bytes (16 bits) and calling it <br />
    as integer.

> - A data type decreases the coding effort.
