## Advantages of Abstract Data Typing

| (1) Encapsulation |
| ----------------- |
| Abstraction provides a promise that any implementation of the <br /> ADT has certain properties and abilities; knowing these <br /> is all that is required to make use of an ADT object. |
| The user does not need any technical knowledge of how the <br /> implementation works to use the ADT. |
