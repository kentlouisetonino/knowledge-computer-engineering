## Digital Logic Design

<br />

`Digital CIrcuit`

> - Electronic circuit built by interconnection of components (`Logic Gates`).

> - `Logic Gate` is an electronic device used to implement a logic operation <br />
    (AND, OR, NOT).

> - Primitive gates.

> - Other gates: `NAND`, `NOR`, `XOR`, `XNOR`.

<br />
<br />

`Digital Logic Design`

> - Process in which functional design of a digital circuit is represented <br />
    in terms of logic operations.
