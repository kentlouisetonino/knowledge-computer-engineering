## Digital Logic Design

<br />

`Digital CIrcuit`

> - Electronic circuit built by interconnection of components (`Logic Gates`).

> - `Logic Gate` is an electronic device used to implement a logic operation <br />
    (AND, OR, NOT).

> - Primitive gates.

> - Other gates: `NAND`, `NOR`, `XOR`, `XNOR`.

<br />
<br />

`Digital Logic Design`

> - Process in which functional design of a digital circuit is represented <br />
    in terms of logic operations.

<br />

<br />



## Digital vs. Analog

<br />

`Analog Systems`

> - Process information having continuous values.

> - Represented using a time-varying quantity such as voltage.

> - Examples: audio recordings and playback, older video signal technologies <br />
    (such as VGA, S-video, etc.).

<br />
<br >

`Digital Systems`

> - Manipulate information having discrete or discontinuous values.

> - Represented using discrete set of values.

> - Example: ON/OFF switch, audio recording from microphone, etc.

## Representation of Discrete information

> - Discrete elements of information are represented in digital systems <br />
    by combinations of binary values (`High (1)` or `Low (0)`).

> - Binary values represented in Digital systems with physical <br />
    quantities (`Binary Signals`).

> - Examples: voltage signal.

> - Signal has only two discrete values - `High (5V)` & `Low (0V)`.
