### CAPITALIZATION
#
> - Certain terms used in the course, such as Workflow, Activity, and Event History,
    are capitalized.

> - This is a convention that we use at Temporal to help distinguish between a
    general concept (shown in lowercase, by conventionn) and a Temporal-specific
    implementation (show in uppercase, by convention).

> - For example, we would use "workflow" to describe a business process, but would
    use "Workflow" to describe and implementation of that business process that
    uses Temporal's APIs.
