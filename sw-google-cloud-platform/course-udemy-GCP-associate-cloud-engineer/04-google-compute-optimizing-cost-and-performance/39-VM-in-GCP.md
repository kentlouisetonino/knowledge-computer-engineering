## Virtual Machine - Remember

> - Associated with a project.

> - Machine type availability can vary from region to regions.

> - You can only change the machine type of a stopped instance.

> - Instances are Zonal (Run in a specific zone in a specific region).

```plaintext
- Images are global (you can provide access to other projects - if needed).
- Instances templates are global (Unless you use zonal resources in your templates).
```

> - Automatic basic monitoring is enabled.
