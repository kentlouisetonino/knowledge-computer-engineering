## Sustained Use Discounts

> - Automatic discounts for running VM instances for <br />
    significant portion of the billing month.

```plaintext
- If you use N1, N2 machine types for more than 25% of a month,
  you get a 20% to 50% discount on every incremental minute.

- Discount increases with usage (Graph).

- No action requried on your part.
```

> - Applicable for instances created by Google Kubernetes <br />
    Engine and Compute Engine.

> - Does not apply on certain machine types (eg. E2 and A2).
