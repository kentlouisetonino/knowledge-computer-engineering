## Best Practices

> - Choose `Zone` and `Region` based on:

```plaintext
- Cost, regulations, availability of needs, latency and
  specific hardware needs.
- Distribute instances in multiple zones and region for
  high availability.
```

> - Choose right machine type:

```plaintext
- Play with them to find out the right machine type.
- Use GPUs for Math and Graphic intensive applications.
```

> - Reserve for `committed use discounts` for constant workfloads.

> - Use preemptible instances for `fault-tolerant`, non-time <br />
    critical workloads.

> - Use `labels` to indicate environment, team, business unit, etc.
